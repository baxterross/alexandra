					Over the last decade, Alex has developed extensive vocal experience, from performing Carmina Burana on a Greek island with 2,000 other singers in the Festival of the Aegean to embodying one half of duo Guitaria with contemporary composer/guitarist Peter Yates.
				    She also sings Bulgarian, Georgian, and other types of folk music from Eastern Europe.
				    Most recently, she has been invited to sing with the 2016 Norfolk Chamber Music Festival Chamber Choir under Simon Carrington.
					Alex's favorite type of vocal performance remains music written before 1650, as can be seen through her involvement with early music groups such as
					<a href="http://www.jouyssance.org" target="_blank">Jouyssance</a> and the UCLA Early Music Ensemble.
				    She is currently Alto Section Leader at
				    <a href="http://santamonicaumc.org/" target="_blank">First United Methodist Church of Santa Monica</a> and the
				    <a href="http://www.sgvccsingers.org/"  target="_blank">San Gabriel Valley Choral Company</a>.

					Having received a thorough education in both piano performance and music theory, Alex is an ardent pianist who loves keyboards of all sorts,
